## Lectures

A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing.
Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture.

Additionally, some lectures will feature application exercises that will be graded.

You are expected to bring a laptop to each class so that you can take part in the in-class exercises.


## Assessment

Assessment for the course is comprised of two components: 

- [Application exercises](application-exercises)
- [E-exam](exams)

(application-exercises)=
### Application exercises

Parts of some lectures will be dedicated to working on "Application Exercises" (AE). These  exercises will give you an opportunity to practice apply the concepts and code introduced in the readings and lectures. 


:::{Note}
AEs should be completed and **submitted individually**.

### Exam

## Course policies

### Academic integrity

**TL;DR: Don't cheat!**

All students must adhere to the academic integrity standard. Students affirm their commitment to uphold the values by signing a pledge that states:

-   I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
-   I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors;
-   I will act if the standard is compromised

Regardless of the course delivery format, it is your responsibility to understand and follow HdM policies regarding academic integrity, including doing one's own work, following proper citation of sources, and adhering to guidance around group work projects.


### Late work policy

There is no late work policy for the *application exercises* and the *exam*.
